# TG_030x_Concatenate
Concatenates LIs into csv
LI_030x.exe is intended for use in conjunction with Environ’s ATLG_Tool. This program concatenates all TG030x files into one file for input into the ATLG_Tool.

The following provides background information:

•	LTR uses the ATLG_Tool to screen for egregious throughput values caused by malfunctioning level indicators.

•	The throughput values from the ATLG_Tool are not intended for emission reporting (as of 2/22/17); rather they are used as a screening tool to quickly identify egregious throughput values.

•	The program will output an Excel file titled “TG_030x” at the location of the ‘TG_0301’,‘TG_0302’,‘TG_0303’, ‘TG_0304’, ‘TG_0305’files. 

•	The program will also accept any combination of the ‘TG_0301’,‘TG_0302’,‘TG_0303’, ‘TG_0304’, ‘TG_0305’ files and still output a “TG_030x” file.
